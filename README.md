# Using Impress.JS and d3 together to make an automatic 3d rotating slidshow
So the plan here, was to layout and associate data using d3, then use impress.js to create a moving slideshow over that layout.

Ended up using those two, and packer.js, which enabled efficient packing of the text into a more local space.
